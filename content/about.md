Hey! 
My name is Pavel Gordon. I am a passionate Java/Kotlin software engineer. 

Being born in Russia, life brought me to Hamburg, Germany, where I write code at FreeNOW (formerly mytaxi), biggest European ride-hailing app. As a developer in allocation team, I improve our dispatching system - reduce waiting time for passengers, optimize distribution of tours for drivers.

I spend my free time travelling and improving my knowledge of foreign languages.
