Hey! 
My name is Pavel Gordon. I am a backend (Java/Kotlin) software engineer with 4+ years of professional experience and passion for clean and performant code. I build distributed, robust and fault-tolerant services for businesses.

 Born in Russia, life brought me to Hamburg, where I write code for FreeNOW(former myTaxi), biggest European ride-hailing app. As an engineer in allocation team, I constantly improve our dispatching system - reduce waiting time for passengers, optimize the distribution of tours in different markets.

  I always push myself to be a better developer and stay up to date with the latest technology trends. I participate and (occasionally) win at hackathons, visit various IT conferences across the globe. 

In my free time I travel across the world, play videogames and learn new languages.
