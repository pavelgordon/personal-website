Hey! 
My name is Pavel Gordon. I am a passionate Java/Kotlin software engineer. 

Originally from Russia, life brought me to Hamburg, Germany, where I write code at FreeNOW(formerly mytaxi), biggest European ride-hailing app. As a developer in allocation team, I improve our dispatching system - reduce waiting time for passengers, optimize distribution of tours for drivers.

I spend my free time with learning languages and occasionally - travels.

Check out my other projects :)
